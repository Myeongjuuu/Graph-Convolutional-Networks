## Dataset: Cora

- **Nodes:** Scientific publications  
  Each node represents an academic paper.

- **Edges:** Citation relationships  
  An edge exists between two papers if one cites the other.

- **Node Features:** Word vectors  
  Each publication is represented by a 1,433-dimensional bag-of-words feature vector.

- **Labels (7 Classes):** Publication subjects  
  The Cora dataset contains 2,708 papers classified into 7 research categories.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** can learn node representations by leveraging both **graph structure** and **node features**.  
The objective is to classify each publication into its corresponding research topic based on citation relationships.
